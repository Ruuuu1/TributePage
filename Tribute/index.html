                    <b>Ariana Grande</b>
                    in full Ariana Grande-Butera, (born June 26, 1993, Boca Raton,
                    Florida, U.S.), American pop singer and actress who burst onto
                    the pop music scene in the early 2010s and became one of the
                    genre’s most successful performers, known for her four-octave
                    range.Grande began singing and acting when she was young. In 2008 she won
                    a role in the Broadway play 13, and she soon began appearing in bit parts on
                    television shows. Her big break came in 2010 when she landed a role on the
                    Nickelodeon TV series Victorious. She played Cat Valentine, a teenager
                    attending a performing arts school. After the sitcom was canceled in 2013,
                    she starred in the spin-off show Sam & Cat (2013–14).
                    While pursuing her acting career, Grande perfected her singing. In 2011 she released
                    the single “Put Your Hearts Up” (she later disparaged the song and music video for its teen
                    vibe). Her debut album, Yours Truly, appeared two years later, and it included the popular
                    single “The Way,” a collaboration with rapper Mac Miller. The album debuted at number one
                    on the Billboard 200 chart and was widely praised. With her R&B-infused pop music and
                    impressive vocal range, Grande earned comparisons to Mariah Carey.
                    With this success, Grande began to shift her focus to music. Her secon album, My Everything, was
                    released in 2014, and it established her as a pop star. The recording, which also debuted at number
                    one, included collaborations with such singers as The Weeknd, Iggy Azalea, and Childish Gambino
                    (Donald Glover). My Everything, as well as the song “Bang Bang” featuring Jessie J and Nicki Minaj,
                    earned Grande her first Grammy Award nominations.
                    Ariana Grande For Dangerous Woman (2016), Grande once again worked
                    with well-known artists, such as Lil’ Wayne and Minaj. <p>In May 2017,
                    during her tour in support of the album, a suicide bomber killed more
                    than 20 people at an arena after a concert in Manchester, England.
                    Grande subsequently organized a benefit concert to raise funds for
                    those affected. Stars participating in the event included Katy Perry,
                    Justin Bieber, and Miley Cyrus. In 2018 Grande released a four-part
                    documentary series on YouTube called Dangerous Woman Diaries.
                    It included behind-the-scenes footage of the tour as well as clips
                    from the making of her next album, Sweetener (2018).
                    Like two of Grande’s three previous albums, Sweetener reached number one on the Billboard 200 chart
                    (Dangerous Woman peaked at number two). It included the songs “God Is a Woman,” “No Tears Left to
                    Cry,” and “The Light Is Coming,” the latter of which featured Minaj. Sweetener received widespread
                    acclaim, and it won the Grammy for best pop vocal album. In 2019 Grande released Thank U, Next. The
                    title track, as well as such songs as “Ghostin” and “7 Rings,” included glimpses into her personal
                    life. Her sixth studio album, Positions, appeared in 2020. During this time, Grande also sang on
                    other artists’ tracks, and her collaboration with Lady Gaga on “Rain on Me” (2020) resulted in her
                    second Grammy Award, for best pop duo/group performance.
                    In 2021 Grande became a coach on the televised singing competition The Voice.</p>
